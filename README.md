<h3> How it works </h3>
<div class = "container mt-3">
  
  <p> This application aims to aid language learning by turning subtitle files into a learning plan!  </p>
  
  <p> It works by taking an uploaded text file, parsing it, and sending a request to an internal translation API</p>
  
  <p> The app then displays translations records in several formats</p>
  </div>
<h4> Translation Mode </h4>
<div class= "container mt-4" >
  <p>
    In this mode the user sees a translation. They can "flip" it to see the translation in their base language. They can also play the translation with the press of the "Play Translation" button which makes a call to OpenAi's text-to-speech API.
    </p>
</div>

<h4> Multiple Choice Mode </h4>
<div class= "container mt-4" >
  <p>
    In multiple choice mode the user is given a translation in their target language and they are tasked with selecting the correct translation in their base language from the dropdown list
    </p>
</div>
<h4> Text-to-speech </h4>
<div class= "container mt-4" >
  <p>
    This function works by making a call to OpenAi's tts API and handling the response with jquery. This is a very neat feature, and everyone should make sure to check it out!
    </p>
</div>


A user uploads a file

a call is made to the perform function in the app/jobs/parse_file_to_database.rb file

that function parses the file line by line and makes requests to the <hyperlink> translation service </hyperlink>

upon success the translation service responds with the translation in the requested language .

this translation, along with the original line is committed to a new Translation model record

after some time there can be an intermittent PG::BAD_CONNECTION error, so there is retry logic in place in the perform function to make the job picks up where it left off in the event of this error.

These records can be viewed in <existing links> and the logic for those programs is described below

app/views/homepage â€”
				the instructions and landing page

app/views/learning_paths
				views related to the main view

app/views/translations
				views related to individual translations

logic related to what is displayed can generally be found in the controllers section

the tts controller contains a function responsible for making requests to openai and sending the received binary file to the view where the
file is assigned to a (jquery) blob and played immediately

aside from that the app structure generally follows a typical rails application
